\* Submit: sender stamps T_hw, which yields cslot = current_slot at emission.
\* Network may deliver this arbitrarily later (no ordering, no time bound).

\* C-SLOT ADMISSION (default build — late tolerated, nothing dropped).
\* Local, O(1) decision. The node admits m iff it has not already been
\* processed AND the slot the message belongs to has been reached
\* (m.cslot <= current_slot). The message keeps its own C_slot.
\* Late delivery (m.cslot < current_slot) is ADMITTED, not dropped: it is
\* placed into its own (earlier) slot. Nothing is lost.
\* Future-dated (m.cslot > current_slot) waits: it cannot be admitted
\* before the ticker reaches its slot (that slot has not happened yet).
Process(n, m) ==
    /\ n \in Nodes
    /\ m \in network

    /\ processed' = [processed EXCEPT ![n] = @ \cup {m.id}]

\* Adversarial duplicate / replay injection.
\* Attacker injects a message with arbitrary cslot value (past, present,
\* or future). The C-slot gate must still hold.

\* No node processes the same id twice (set semantics + guard).
ExactlyOncePerNode ==
    \A n \in Nodes : Cardinality(processed[n]) <= Cardinality(MsgIDs)

\* I2: NO FUTURE ADMISSION (the headline safety property).
\* A node never admits a message whose slot has not yet been reached.
\* The gate is m.cslot <= current_slot and current_slot is monotonic,
\* so every admitted id has a network record whose cslot lies in
\* [0, current_slot]: a real, present-or-past slot, never future-dated.
\* Late messages (cslot < current_slot) ARE admitted here (into their
\* own slot) — that is intended; only future-dated admission is barred.

\* Every processed id corresponds to a real network record.
NoPhantomProcess ==
    \A n \in Nodes : processed[n] \subseteq {m.id : m \in network}

\* I5: DECISION LOCALITY.
\* If two nodes have both processed id, that id exists in network.
\* Structural consequence: the gate depends only on (m.cslot, current_slot),
\* not on n. Same (m.cslot, current_slot) => same decision at every node.
